 # Hi...!!!

- ðŸŒ± Welcome to my repository
- ðŸ”­ I am a 4th-year undergrad at IIT Gandhinagar. I adore algorithms and maths in general and AI in particular. Making machine learning models to solve challenges in the fields of vision, language, and robotics is something I really enjoy doing.
- ðŸ”­ Currently, I am working as an ML Research intern at TCS Research India to devise a reference-free metric for a Multimodal fashion dataset.
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on representation learning projects.

- âš¡ Fun fact:  In the summer of 2023, I had a remarkable experience as a MITACS GRI at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, working on multimodal representation learning with a focus on video and brain signals.
