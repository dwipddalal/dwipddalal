 # Hi...!!!

- ðŸŒ± Welcome to my repository
- ðŸ”­ I am a 3rd-year undergrad at IIT Gandhinagar. I adore algorithms and maths in general and AI in particular. Making machine learning models to solve challenges in the field of robotics is something I really enjoy doing.
- ðŸ”­ Currently, I am working as a ML Research intern at TCS Research India for devising a reference-free metric for Multimodal fashion dataset.
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on projects on computer vision and natural language processing.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm visiting University of British Columbia in the coming summer as a research intern to work on creating behavioural videos from brain data under prof Yankai Cao, as part of MITACS GRI Program!
